Most software needs updating after its initial release to address bugs, newly identified vulnerabilities, and revisions to features and functionality. But software patches and other changes can introduce new cybersecurity and privacy risks and can impair operations if not managed effectively. To support successful, secure software updates and patches, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized modifications to its catalog of security and privacy safeguards to assist both the developers who create patches and the organizations that receive and implement them in their own systems.
  - _Mappings_: NIST SP 800-53 (indicative): AC-2, AC-3, CM-3, RA-5, SC-12, SC-13, SI-2; NIST SP 800-171 (indicative): 3.1, 3.11, 3.13, 3.14, 3.4; NIST SP 800-218 SSDF (indicative): GV.1, PO.5, PW.10, RV.1, RV.3
- Update management can be challenging because of the need to balance the trade-offs between deploying patches quickly to address critical vulnerabilities or bugs and thoroughly testing to ensure that critical functions and services are not affected. Once a vendor detects a vulnerability in its software, deploying a patch quickly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers, but it increases the risk that the less thoroughly tested patch might disrupt an organization’s operations. Conversely, thorough testing decreases the risk of operational disruption but increases the window of opportunity for attackers.

“The updated controls emphasize the importance of monitoring the particular component being updated as well as the component’s relationship to the overall system,” Pillitteri said.

- The complete set of changes is available at the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool ([CPRT](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog)), where the updated version is listed as [SP 800-53 Rev. 5.2.0](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_2_0/home).

In addition, NIST is now providing updates to the control catalog through CPRT, which allows downloads in machine-readable formats including OSCAL and JSON. The agency has also adopted a new public engagement process that allows stakeholders to respond to proposed changes in real time during comment periods, and to make suggestions at any time.

Pillitteri said that the new engagement process will allow NIST to maintain its usual rigor and transparency, while the different available formats make it easier for users to implement the updated controls.

- Following the completion of the comment period, NIST will review and adjudicate comments. NIST SP 800-53 Release 5.2.0 will be issued on or before September 2, 2025, as an online dataset on the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool.

- NIST announces an update of **[Special Publication (SP) 800-128](/pubs/sp/800/128/upd1/final)** _**, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems** , _which provides guidelines for organizations responsible for managing and administering the security of federal systems and associated environments of operation. The document focuses on the implementation of system security aspects of configuration management, and as such, the term “security-focused configuration management” (SecCM) is used to emphasize the concentration on information security. NIST has released an errata update to reflect changes that have occurred in technology, terminology, and references since the document’s original publication in 2011. No significant or technical changes have been made to the recommended guidance for SecCM.

- Enterprise patch management is the process of identifying, prioritizing, acquiring, installing, and verifying the installation of patches, updates, and upgrades throughout an organization. Patching is more important than ever because of the increasing reliance on technology, but there is often a divide between business/mission owners and security/technology management about the value of patching. This publication frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies – a cost of doing business, and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to achieve their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise patch management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and operationalize patching while also improving reduction of risk. Preventive maintenance through enterprise patch management helps prevent compromises, data breaches, operational disruptions, and other adverse events.
